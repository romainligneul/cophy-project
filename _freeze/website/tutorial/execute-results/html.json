It does\nnot do much, besides providing an extensively configured header. The\nheader contains various fields that provide standard information about\nthe paper and some formatting rendering options. Check it out.\n\n## References\n\nIt is quite easy to include citations. You can either use Crtl+Shit+F8\nto call the utility of Quarto to add from your local Zotero (and other\nsources), or you can populate manually your references.bib file and\nwrite down citation keys directly [@abbasi2023]. Look at the end of this\nfile to see how the bibliography is inserted.\n\n## Automatic inclusion of statistics\n\nTo include statistics automatically, you need to **include** additional\n.qmd files. Here, we include the following file\n`functions/_stats_format.qmd`. This allows us to write down statistics\nin using the following expression: \\[TTEST STATS: no match or too many matches\\!\\].\n\nHere is a result based on the output from Matlab's ttest() function,\ndisplayed automatically: \\[TTEST STATS: no match or too many matches\\!\\]\n\nHere is another results based on the output from R lm() function:\n\\[Rreg STATS: no match or too many matches\\!\\]\n\n## Automatic inclusion of images\n\nThere are various ways to include images in a document. At the simplest,\nyou just need to reference the image path and possibly add some\nformatting parameters. For example:\n\nBut we can also make use of Quarto layouts.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n## Figures\n\n### Insert pre-generated figure\n\n![Example\nFigure](../_analyses/figures/writingTime.png){#fig-exampleImported\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" fig-cap-location=\"bottom\"}\n\n### Insert Python figure (matplotlib)\n\n::: {width=\"100%\"}\n\n::: {#1bafe098 .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Example Python Figure with Caption.
