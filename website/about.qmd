This website provides information about the template used for new scientific projects in the COPHY team. Like the template itself, the website may change and grow over time.


## Idea

All scientific project share similar components and they can therefore be integrated within a standard template, provided that the template is flexible enough. Templating does not only facilitate collaborative open science, it can also greatly accelerate the overall scientific process, thanks to a myriad of excellent tools such as Git, Quarto, Jupyter, etc.

## How to contribute

To contribute to the development and conception of the template, you can write to [romain.ligneul\@inserm.fr](mailto:romain.ligneul@inserm.fr). You'll need a [Github account](github.com).
